          Programming has been my passion for over 6 years. Over time, I became
          interested in the front-end and related technologies, including React,
          which for me is currently in the first place. It pays a lot of
          attention to the aesthetics and operation of the projects I perform. I
          often design templates by myself. I worked with many languages and
          technologies, but the most I liked javascript and its ecosystem.
